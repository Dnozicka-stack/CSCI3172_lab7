Testing: 
I tested my application first by opening the website in a variety of browsers. I made sure all the links worked, and that the content I uploaded (headshot and resume) were displayed properly. I also made sure I could use the download button on my resume page. I also played around with different window sizes, ensuring my website adapted and still fit styling guidelines.
